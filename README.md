# Human Detection Model for Social Media Profile Verification

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model aimed at ensuring that social media applications like Instagram use human images for profile pictures. This model helps prevent the use of non-human images such as animals or objects, maintaining the authenticity of user profiles.

## Model Description
The human detection model is implemented using [insert technology, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras] and is saved in a `.h5` format. It uses a [insert model architecture, e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)] trained on a comprehensive dataset of human and non-human images. This training is documented in a Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone URL`
2. **Model File**: The trained model is stored as `model.h5`. You can load this model using Keras with `keras.models.load_model('model.h5')`.
3. **Training Notebook**: Explore the training process in the provided Jupyter Notebook (`training_notebook.ipynb`). You can run this notebook to understand the model training steps and modify it as needed.
